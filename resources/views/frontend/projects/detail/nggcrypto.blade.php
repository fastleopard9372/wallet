      Why Almost 50% Of Retiring Australians Rely On The Pension As Their Main Income Source?
    </div>
    <div>
      According to the ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics) 2018-2019 report on Australian retirement, they found
      that the full single rate age pension only provides around 27% of full-time adult average weekly earnings. ABS
      (2018) <br /><br />
      This same report that found that 49-50% of men, and 44-45% of women rely on this as their MAIN source of income.
      Now, this could be an assumption - but I think it's fair to say that if you're reading this, you DON'T want to
      end up pension-reliant in retirement. <br /><br />
      Chances are, you'll want to spend your golden years in your own mortgage-free home, traveling and living your
      golden years to the fullest, and still having enough left over to give the kids a good head start!
