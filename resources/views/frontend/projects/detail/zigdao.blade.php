      The Z-Score AI algorithm uses intricate weighting and multifaceted factors like profitability, risk, and
      consistency to identify top traders. Only the best traders can be listed on ZIGDAO.

    <div class="guide_qa">
      <div>
        <h4>1. How is ZIGDAO different than other similar platforms?</h4>
        <p>
          Our (not-so) secret sauce is a scoring algorithm (the Z-Score) powered by AI that highlights the best
          traders based on your risk appetite and return expectations. Once you have selected the trader, our
          technology takes care of everything, so you can relax and watch your assets grow.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>2. How is profit sharing beneficial over copy-trading?</h4>
        <div>
          We tried copy-trading for over 3 years but soon realized there were better ways to share a winning trading
          strategy than copy-trading. With copy-trading, you are subject to slippage, you can't follow several
          services from the same account, you need an account with the same properties as the trader ones, and you
          need a minimum balance. You can't ever expect the same results when following with copy-trading.
          Profit-Sharing guarantees identical results.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>3. How much do ZIGDAO services cost?</h4>
        <p>
          An account on ZIGDAO is free; you only pay a performance fee, a percentage of the earnings you get from the
          different services; we call it "Success Fee."
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>4. How much can I start with?</h4>
        <p>The average investment is around $200, but there isn't any minimum.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>5. Is there a difference in returns between large and small investors?</h4>
        <p>
          No, in ZIGDAO, we do not distinguish between large or small investors; our goal is to offer the best service
          and the same opportunities to everybody around the world.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>6. How can I deposit FIAT money on the platform (EUR or USD)?</h4>
        <p>You can't. But if you are serious about this, you can convert your FIAT.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>7. Can I withdraw at any time?</h4>
        <p>
          Our technology permits the trader to liberate funds to withdraw at any time. You still have to wait until
          the daily settlement once the funds are available, but it takes less than 24h.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>8. Is it Zignaly or ZIGDAO?</h4>
        <p>
          We started as Zignaly, and during 5 years, we iterated and tuned our service until what we have today.
          Zignaly launched the ZIG token and plans to become a DAO, so we are rebranding ourselves as ZIGDAO.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>9. Can I join ZIGDAO if I register as a trader?</h4>
        <p>
          There is no difference at the moment of registration; after creating the account, you can offer your trading
          services. How ever you will not be listed as a PRO and in our marketplace until we collect enough data on
          your performance.
