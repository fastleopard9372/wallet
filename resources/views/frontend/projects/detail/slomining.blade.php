        <div>
          <h4>1. What is Cloud Mining?</h4>
          <p>
            Cloud mining is a method of cryptocurrency mining where individuals lease computing power from remote data
            centers, eliminating the need to purchase and maintain hardware. Miners rent hashing power from third-party
            providers to participate in mining, and rewards are proportionate to the rented computing capacity.
