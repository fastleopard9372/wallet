      <div class="guide_title">Questions and Answers :</div>
      <ol>
        <li>What is Bitcoin mining?</li>
        <p>
          Cryptocurrency mining is the generation of new coins, which is done through mathematical calculations of
          hash functions to carry out transactions in a cryptocurrency network. It is what BTC mining and many other
          cryptocurrencies are based on. All these calculations and transfers of cryptocurrency take place on the
          blockchain. Each blockchain has a unique hash. To calculate one block in the chain, we need to find the hash
          from the previous block.
        </p>
        <li>Why do I need to mine BTC?</li>
        <p>
          People use bitcoin mining to generate income. How does it work? The blockchain gives a reward to the miner
          for computing. The more powerful the miner's equipment, the more benefit he can bring to the blockchain, the
          more rewards he will receive. To generate income, you just need to create a crypto wallet and receive
          rewards.
        </p>
        <li>Is Bitcoin mining profitable?</li>
        <p>
          BTC mining is the most profitable way to mine cryptocurrency. It is the same as printing money for yourself.
          You get a regular and stable income, while other ways of investing in cryptocurrencies are much riskier and
          less predictable.
        </p>
        <li>How to start mining bitcoins?</li>
        <p>
          There are two main ways of BTC mining: home mining and cloud mining. Home mining was popular at the
          beginning of the formation of the crypto market, but over time, the industry became more complicated, and
          the process became more expensive. Cloud mining has become more profitable and simpler alternative. It made
          it possible to mine cryptocurrencies remotely by leasing the capacity of large data centers.
        </p>
        <li>What is a crypto mining platform?</li>
        <p>
          A crypto mining platform is a website or application that allows you to mine cryptocurrencies without
          purchasing and maintaining hardware. You can choose a contract for mining the desired cryptocurrency and
          track this process on these platforms. It is also possible to withdraw money in a convenient currency. ECOS
          is one of the most convenient bitcoin mining platforms.
        </p>
        <li>How does Bitcoin mining work in ECOS?</li>
        <p>
          Previously, to mine cryptocurrencies, you had to buy equipment and then recoup its cost. ECOS allows you to
          start mining right now with a minimum cost threshold.
