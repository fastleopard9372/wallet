        <p>
          The price of digital assets often fluctuates greatly, and the mining difficulty of each currency will be
          adjusted regularly. The decrease of currency price or the increase of difficulty will lead to the decrease
          of the yield of each mining machine. No matter from the point of view of digital assets or legal currency,
          this product does not guarantee that users can return the cost. Users need to carefully assess their risk
          tolerance and invest in digital asset mining within acceptable risk control.
